            <p>Before I learned to walk, I learned to play music. Okay, maybe that' a bit of an exaggeration. I started
            playing the alto saxophone in 1st grade. By middle school I had learned the trombone, piano, and had fallen
            in love with the guitar. I was in pop-punk bands in highschool and to this day pick up my guitar when I need
            some relaxion time.</p>

            about the sport. I've played since high school and still get together my friends for some pick up games on weekends.
